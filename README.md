# MuralX — Explore, Express, Experience

## Mission
Art should be accessible to everyone, not a privilege of the few. MuralX democratizes commissioned art, making it a shared experience for artists, patrons, and the wider community.

## Background
Historically, commissioning art was reserved for wealthy patrons. Even today, finding artwork that truly resonates can feel overwhelming or out of reach. MuralX was inspired by the idea that creativity should belong to all, and that technology can help bridge the gap between artists and those who appreciate their work.

## Project Overview
MuralX is a decentralized platform where users can commission, create, and share art. Built for all, anyone can act as a patron or an artist. Built by all, blockchain technology ensures the commission process is fair, transparent, and secure, with no platform commission. The platform fosters a community where creativity is shared, celebrated, and accessible to everyone.
